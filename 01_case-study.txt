1. As a manager to handle this situation, first I will ask what is his/her problem. 
Because the mental health of my members is important to me, the first thing I will do is give him time to fix his problem, 
don't think about other things first because it's hard to function when you haven't solved a problem and there is. 
Something else will be added, and it will affect the project timeline even more if my employees are out of order. 
And I will tell my client that there will be a few changes that will happen 
but the project timeline that is being done will not be affected and I will tell this to the team 
so that the work on the project will continue. And when my teammate is okay, he can do the things I ask him to do more easily.

2. The first thing I will do is talk to my manager and I will tell him that there was an emergency in our family
I will also tell him that our project timeline will not be affected in this situation 
so that the project timeline can still be maintained properly Even if there was an emergency.

3. To avoid and reduce problems, 
you must always be alert to what you are doing and always be ready if there is a problem 
because the thinking of the manager and developer is that they must know what they are doing so that if there is a problem, 
they can easily solve it. And can do the action that will not cause problems in project timelines 
because this is the most difficult where if we don't prepare a problem it can increase until our project timeline is broken and 
we can't achieve our goal. So we should always double-check and test if the systems we develop are working. 
The most important of all is the communication of each one, because we know something that they don't know, 
and we have something that they don't know that they know how to solve. So I can say that communication is the key.
